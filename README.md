# Iris_Classification

This project was completed for CS-UY 1114 and is an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm applied to the Iris dataset. Features such as petal length and width are used to classify datapoints as different iris flower types. The code for this project includes both the classification algorithm as well as visualizations for the K-means results.
